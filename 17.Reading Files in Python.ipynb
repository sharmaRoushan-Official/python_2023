       "'The Boy Who Cried Wolf\\n\\nLong ago, in a quiet little village at the edge of a forest, there lived\\na young shepherd boy. His daily duty was simple yet important: he had to\\ntake the flock of sheep to graze on the hillside and watch over them so\\nthat no harm came to them.\\n\\nThe villagers depended on these sheep for wool, milk, and sometimes\\nmeat. Protecting them from wild animals, especially wolves, was\\nconsidered a great responsibility. Though the boy was trusted with this\\nimportant task, he often found the work boring. The sheep quietly grazed\\non the grass, the birds chirped softly, and the warm sun passed slowly\\nacross the sky.\\n\\nAt first, the boy tried to entertain himself by humming songs, throwing\\npebbles into the stream, or counting the sheep. But day after day, the\\nsame routine wore him out. He longed for excitement, something to break\\nthe silence of the long afternoons.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe First Trick\\n\\nOne afternoon, as the boy sat watching the flock, a mischievous idea\\nstruck him. He thought, â€œIf only something exciting would happen. What\\nif I pretend that a wolf has come? The villagers would rush up the hill,\\nand it would be funny to see their faces when they realize thereâ€™s no\\nwolf at all!â€\\n\\nSo, standing up, he cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted\\nloudly:\\n\\nâ€œWolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing my sheep!â€\\n\\nThe villagers, hearing his cries of alarm, dropped their tools and\\nrushed up the hill. Some carried sticks, others picked up stones, all\\nready to protect the flock. But when they arrived, panting and sweating,\\nthey saw no wolf at all. The sheep grazed peacefully, and the boy sat\\nlaughing uncontrollably.\\n\\nâ€œHa ha ha! I fooled you all!â€ he chuckled.\\n\\nThe villagers frowned. An old man said sternly, â€œDo not cry wolf when\\nthere is no wolf, boy. It is not a game. We came here to help you.â€\\n\\nBut the boy only laughed harder. When the villagers went back down the\\nhill, he felt proud of his cleverness.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Second Trick\\n\\nThe very next day, the boy grew bored again. Remembering the fun he had\\nyesterday, he decided to play the same trick once more.\\n\\nHe stood up, jumped about, and cried even louder:\\n\\nâ€œWolf! Wolf! Please come quickly! A wolf is attacking the sheep!â€\\n\\nThe villagers looked at each other. â€œCould it be true this time?â€ they\\nwondered. Despite their doubts, they rushed up the hill once again.\\n\\nBut once more, they found no wolf. The boy was rolling on the ground\\nwith laughter.\\n\\nâ€œYou should have seen how fast you all ran!â€ he giggled.\\n\\nThis time, the villagers were truly angry. One woman shook her finger at\\nhim and said, â€œBoy, this is no laughing matter. You wasted our time and\\nmade fools of us. If you cry wolf again, we may not believe you!â€\\n\\nThe boy shrugged, unconcerned. In his mind, it was only harmless fun.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Real Wolf\\n\\nA few days later, while the sheep grazed peacefully, the boy suddenly\\nheard a rustling sound from the nearby bushes. He turned his head and\\nhis heart skipped a beat. Out of the forest emerged a large, gray wolf\\nwith gleaming eyes and sharp teeth.\\n\\nThe wolf crept closer, snarling and baring its fangs. The sheep bleated\\nin fear, scattering in all directions. The boyâ€™s face turned pale. He\\nleaped to his feet and screamed with all his might:\\n\\nâ€œWolf! Wolf! Please help me! A real wolf is here! Itâ€™s attacking the\\nsheep!â€\\n\\nThis time, however, the villagers only shook their heads when they heard\\nhis cries.\\n\\nâ€œThat boy is making a fool of us again,â€ said one man. â€œLet him deal\\nwith his own mischief,â€ replied another.\\n\\nNot a single villager climbed the hill.\\n\\nThe boy shouted until his throat was sore. He waved his arms and begged\\nfor help. But no one came. The wolf chased the sheep, caught several of\\nthem, and dragged them into the forest. The boy watched helplessly,\\ntears streaming down his face.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Lesson Learned\\n\\nWhen evening came, the boy returned to the village with only a handful\\nof sheep left. His head hung low, and he could not meet the eyes of the\\nvillagers.\\n\\nâ€œI am so sorry,â€ he sobbed. â€œThere really was a wolf this time. But\\nbecause I lied before, none of you believed me.â€\\n\\nThe old man who had warned him earlier said gently, â€œYes, boy. That is\\nthe way of lies. When a liar speaks the truth, no one believes him.â€\\n\\nFrom that day forward, the boy never lied again. He had learned, through\\nbitter experience, that trust once broken is hard to win back.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Moral\\n\\nâ€œLiars are not believed, even when they tell the truth.â€\\n\\nTrust is a precious gift. Once it is lost through lies or deceit, it is\\ndifficult to regain.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nExtended Reflection\\n\\nThe story of The Boy Who Cried Wolf has been told for centuries, not\\njust to entertain, but to teach a timeless lesson. Parents share it with\\ntheir children to emphasize the importance of honesty. Teachers use it\\nto remind students that lying may bring short-term amusement but can\\ncause long-term harm.\\n\\nIn life, people who lie may gain attention for a while, but when they\\ntruly need help, others hesitate to trust them. In families,\\nfriendships, workplaces, and societies, trust is the foundation of every\\nrelationship. Without it, cooperation and safety break down.\\n\\nThe boy in the story did not just lose his sheepâ€”he lost the confidence\\nof his entire village. The laughter he enjoyed for a moment turned into\\nsorrow that lasted long after the wolf disappeared into the forest.\\n\\nThus, the tale continues to live on, reminding each generation: Speak\\nthe truth, and you will be trusted. Tell lies, and you may find yourself\\nalone when you need others most.\\n'"

       "'The Boy Who Cried Wolf\\n\\nLong ago, in a quiet little village at the edge of a forest, there lived\\na young shepherd boy. His daily duty was simple yet important: he had to\\ntake the flock of sheep to graze on the hillside and watch over them so\\nthat no harm came to them.\\n\\nThe villagers depended on these sheep for wool, milk, and sometimes\\nmeat. Protecting them from wild animals, especially wolves, was\\nconsidered a great responsibility. Though the boy was trusted with this\\nimportant task, he often found the work boring. The sheep quietly grazed\\non the grass, the birds chirped softly, and the warm sun passed slowly\\nacross the sky.\\n\\nAt first, the boy tried to entertain himself by humming songs, throwing\\npebbles into the stream, or counting the sheep. But day after day, the\\nsame routine wore him out. He longed for excitement, something to break\\nthe silence of the long afternoons.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe First Trick\\n\\nOne afternoon, as the boy sat watching the flock, a mischievous idea\\nstruck him. He thought, â€œIf only something exciting would happen. What\\nif I pretend that a wolf has come? The villagers would rush up the hill,\\nand it would be funny to see their faces when they realize thereâ€™s no\\nwolf at all!â€\\n\\nSo, standing up, he cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted\\nloudly:\\n\\nâ€œWolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing my sheep!â€\\n\\nThe villagers, hearing his cries of alarm, dropped their tools and\\nrushed up the hill. Some carried sticks, others picked up stones, all\\nready to protect the flock. But when they arrived, panting and sweating,\\nthey saw no wolf at all. The sheep grazed peacefully, and the boy sat\\nlaughing uncontrollably.\\n\\nâ€œHa ha ha! I fooled you all!â€ he chuckled.\\n\\nThe villagers frowned. An old man said sternly, â€œDo not cry wolf when\\nthere is no wolf, boy. It is not a game. We came here to help you.â€\\n\\nBut the boy only laughed harder. When the villagers went back down the\\nhill, he felt proud of his cleverness.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Second Trick\\n\\nThe very next day, the boy grew bored again. Remembering the fun he had\\nyesterday, he decided to play the same trick once more.\\n\\nHe stood up, jumped about, and cried even louder:\\n\\nâ€œWolf! Wolf! Please come quickly! A wolf is attacking the sheep!â€\\n\\nThe villagers looked at each other. â€œCould it be true this time?â€ they\\nwondered. Despite their doubts, they rushed up the hill once again.\\n\\nBut once more, they found no wolf. The boy was rolling on the ground\\nwith laughter.\\n\\nâ€œYou should have seen how fast you all ran!â€ he giggled.\\n\\nThis time, the villagers were truly angry. One woman shook her finger at\\nhim and said, â€œBoy, this is no laughing matter. You wasted our time and\\nmade fools of us. If you cry wolf again, we may not believe you!â€\\n\\nThe boy shrugged, unconcerned. In his mind, it was only harmless fun.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Real Wolf\\n\\nA few days later, while the sheep grazed peacefully, the boy suddenly\\nheard a rustling sound from the nearby bushes. He turned his head and\\nhis heart skipped a beat. Out of the forest emerged a large, gray wolf\\nwith gleaming eyes and sharp teeth.\\n\\nThe wolf crept closer, snarling and baring its fangs. The sheep bleated\\nin fear, scattering in all directions. The boyâ€™s face turned pale. He\\nleaped to his feet and screamed with all his might:\\n\\nâ€œWolf! Wolf! Please help me! A real wolf is here! Itâ€™s attacking the\\nsheep!â€\\n\\nThis time, however, the villagers only shook their heads when they heard\\nhis cries.\\n\\nâ€œThat boy is making a fool of us again,â€ said one man. â€œLet him deal\\nwith his own mischief,â€ replied another.\\n\\nNot a single villager climbed the hill.\\n\\nThe boy shouted until his throat was sore. He waved his arms and begged\\nfor help. But no one came. The wolf chased the sheep, caught several of\\nthem, and dragged them into the forest. The boy watched helplessly,\\ntears streaming down his face.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Lesson Learned\\n\\nWhen evening came, the boy returned to the village with only a handful\\nof sheep left. His head hung low, and he could not meet the eyes of the\\nvillagers.\\n\\nâ€œI am so sorry,â€ he sobbed. â€œThere really was a wolf this time. But\\nbecause I lied before, none of you believed me.â€\\n\\nThe old man who had warned him earlier said gently, â€œYes, boy. That is\\nthe way of lies. When a liar speaks the truth, no one believes him.â€\\n\\nFrom that day forward, the boy never lied again. He had learned, through\\nbitter experience, that trust once broken is hard to win back.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Moral\\n\\nâ€œLiars are not believed, even when they tell the truth.â€\\n\\nTrust is a precious gift. Once it is lost through lies or deceit, it is\\ndifficult to regain.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nExtended Reflection\\n\\nThe story of The Boy Who Cried Wolf has been told for centuries, not\\njust to entertain, but to teach a timeless lesson.
