       "'The Boy Who Cried Wolf\\n\\nLong ago, in a quiet little village at the edge of a forest, there lived\\na young shepherd boy. His daily duty was simple yet important: he had to\\ntake the flock of sheep to graze on the hillside and watch over them so\\nthat no harm came to them.\\n\\nThe villagers depended on these sheep for wool, milk, and sometimes\\nmeat. Protecting them from wild animals, especially wolves, was\\nconsidered a great responsibility. Though the boy was trusted with this\\nimportant task, he often found the work boring. The sheep quietly grazed\\non the grass, the birds chirped softly, and the warm sun passed slowly\\nacross the sky.\\n\\nAt first, the boy tried to entertain himself by humming songs, throwing\\npebbles into the stream, or counting the sheep. But day after day, the\\nsame routine wore him out. He longed for excitement, something to break\\nthe silence of the long afternoons.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe First Trick\\n\\nOne afternoon, as the boy sat watching the flock, a mischievous idea\\nstruck him. He thought, â€œIf only something exciting would happen. What\\nif I pretend that a wolf has come? The villagers would rush up the hill,\\nand it would be funny to see their faces when they realize thereâ€™s no\\nwolf at all!â€\\n\\nSo, standing up, he cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted\\nloudly:\\n\\nâ€œWolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing my sheep!â€\\n\\nThe villagers, hearing his cries of alarm, dropped their tools and\\nrushed up the hill. Some carried sticks, others picked up stones, all\\nready to protect the flock. But when they arrived, panting and sweating,\\nthey saw no wolf at all. The sheep grazed peacefully, and the boy sat\\nlaughing uncontrollably.\\n\\nâ€œHa ha ha! I fooled you all!â€ he chuckled.\\n\\nThe villagers frowned. An old man said sternly, â€œDo not cry wolf when\\nthere is no wolf, boy. It is not a game. We came here to help you.â€\\n\\nBut the boy only laughed harder. When the villagers went back down the\\nhill, he felt proud of his cleverness.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Second Trick\\n\\nThe very next day, the boy grew bored again. Remembering the fun he had\\nyesterday, he decided to play the same trick once more.\\n\\nHe stood up, jumped about, and cried even louder:\\n\\nâ€œWolf! Wolf! Please come quickly! A wolf is attacking the sheep!â€\\n\\nThe villagers looked at each other. â€œCould it be true this time?â€ they\\nwondered. Despite their doubts, they rushed up the hill once again.\\n\\nBut once more, they found no wolf. The boy was rolling on the ground\\nwith laughter.\\n\\nâ€œYou should have seen how fast you all ran!â€ he giggled.\\n\\nThis time, the villagers were truly angry. One woman shook her finger at\\nhim and said, â€œBoy, this is no laughing matter. You wasted our time and\\nmade fools of us. If you cry wolf again, we may not believe you!â€\\n\\nThe boy shrugged, unconcerned. In his mind, it was only harmless fun.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Real Wolf\\n\\nA few days later, while the sheep grazed peacefully, the boy suddenly\\nheard a rustling sound from the nearby bushes. He turned his head and\\nhis heart skipped a beat. Out of the forest emerged a large, gray wolf\\nwith gleaming eyes and sharp teeth.\\n\\nThe wolf crept closer, snarling and baring its fangs. The sheep bleated\\nin fear, scattering in all directions. The boyâ€™s face turned pale. He\\nleaped to his feet and screamed with all his might:\\n\\nâ€œWolf! Wolf! Please help me! A real wolf is here! Itâ€™s attacking the\\nsheep!â€\\n\\nThis time, however, the villagers only shook their heads when they heard\\nhis cries.\\n\\nâ€œThat boy is making a fool of us again,â€ said one man. â€œLet him deal\\nwith his own mischief,â€ replied another.\\n\\nNot a single villager climbed the hill.\\n\\nThe boy shouted until his throat was sore. He waved his arms and begged\\nfor help. But no one came. The wolf chased the sheep, caught several of\\nthem, and dragged them into the forest. The boy watched helplessly,\\ntears streaming down his face.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Lesson Learned\\n\\nWhen evening came, the boy returned to the village with only a handful\\nof sheep left. His head hung low, and he could not meet the eyes of the\\nvillagers.\\n\\nâ€œI am so sorry,â€ he sobbed. â€œThere really was a wolf this time. But\\nbecause I lied before, none of you believed me.â€\\n\\nThe old man who had warned him earlier said gently, â€œYes, boy. That is\\nthe way of lies. When a liar speaks the truth, no one believes him.â€\\n\\nFrom that day forward, the boy never lied again. He had learned, through\\nbitter experience, that trust once broken is hard to win back.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Moral\\n\\nâ€œLiars are not believed, even when they tell the truth.â€\\n\\nTrust is a precious gift. Once it is lost through lies or deceit, it is\\ndifficult to regain.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nExtended Reflection\\n\\nThe story of The Boy Who Cried Wolf has been told for centuries, not\\njust to entertain, but to teach a timeless lesson. Parents share it with\\ntheir children to emphasize the importance of honesty. Teachers use it\\nto remind students that lying may bring short-term amusement but can\\ncause long-term harm.\\n\\nIn life, people who lie may gain attention for a while, but when they\\ntruly need help, others hesitate to trust them. In families,\\nfriendships, workplaces, and societies, trust is the foundation of every\\nrelationship. Without it, cooperation and safety break down.\\n\\nThe boy in the story did not just lose his sheepâ€”he lost the confidence\\nof his entire village. The laughter he enjoyed for a moment turned into\\nsorrow that lasted long after the wolf disappeared into the forest.\\n\\nThus, the tale continues to live on, reminding each generation: Speak\\nthe truth, and you will be trusted. Tell lies, and you may find yourself\\nalone when you need others most.\\n'"

       "'The Boy Who Cried Wolf\\n\\nLong ago, in a quiet little village at the edge of a forest, there lived\\na young shepherd boy. His daily duty was simple yet important: he had to\\ntake the flock of sheep to graze on the hillside and watch over them so\\nthat no harm came to them.\\n\\nThe villagers depended on these sheep for wool, milk, and sometimes\\nmeat. Protecting them from wild animals, especially wolves, was\\nconsidered a great responsibility. Though the boy was trusted with this\\nimportant task, he often found the work boring. The sheep quietly grazed\\non the grass, the birds chirped softly, and the warm sun passed slowly\\nacross the sky.\\n\\nAt first, the boy tried to entertain himself by humming songs, throwing\\npebbles into the stream, or counting the sheep. But day after day, the\\nsame routine wore him out. He longed for excitement, something to break\\nthe silence of the long afternoons.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe First Trick\\n\\nOne afternoon, as the boy sat watching the flock, a mischievous idea\\nstruck him. He thought, â€œIf only something exciting would happen. What\\nif I pretend that a wolf has come? The villagers would rush up the hill,\\nand it would be funny to see their faces when they realize thereâ€™s no\\nwolf at all!â€\\n\\nSo, standing up, he cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted\\nloudly:\\n\\nâ€œWolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing my sheep!â€\\n\\nThe villagers, hearing his cries of alarm, dropped their tools and\\nrushed up the hill. Some carried sticks, others picked up stones, all\\nready to protect the flock. But when they arrived, panting and sweating,\\nthey saw no wolf at all. The sheep grazed peacefully, and the boy sat\\nlaughing uncontrollably.\\n\\nâ€œHa ha ha! I fooled you all!â€ he chuckled.\\n\\nThe villagers frowned. An old man said sternly, â€œDo not cry wolf when\\nthere is no wolf, boy. It is not a game. We came here to help you.â€\\n\\nBut the boy only laughed harder. When the villagers went back down the\\nhill, he felt proud of his cleverness.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Second Trick\\n\\nThe very next day, the boy grew bored again. Remembering the fun he had\\nyesterday, he decided to play the same trick once more.\\n\\nHe stood up, jumped about, and cried even louder:\\n\\nâ€œWolf! Wolf! Please come quickly! A wolf is attacking the sheep!â€\\n\\nThe villagers looked at each other. â€œCould it be true this time?â€ they\\nwondered. Despite their doubts, they rushed up the hill once again.\\n\\nBut once more, they found no wolf. The boy was rolling on the ground\\nwith laughter.\\n\\nâ€œYou should have seen how fast you all ran!â€ he giggled.\\n\\nThis time, the villagers were truly angry. One woman shook her finger at\\nhim and said, â€œBoy, this is no laughing matter. You wasted our time and\\nmade fools of us. If you cry wolf again, we may not believe you!â€\\n\\nThe boy shrugged, unconcerned. In his mind, it was only harmless fun.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Real Wolf\\n\\nA few days later, while the sheep grazed peacefully, the boy suddenly\\nheard a rustling sound from the nearby bushes. He turned his head and\\nhis heart skipped a beat. Out of the forest emerged a large, gray wolf\\nwith gleaming eyes and sharp teeth.\\n\\nThe wolf crept closer, snarling and baring its fangs. The sheep bleated\\nin fear, scattering in all directions. The boyâ€™s face turned pale. He\\nleaped to his feet and screamed with all his might:\\n\\nâ€œWolf! Wolf! Please help me! A real wolf is here! Itâ€™s attacking the\\nsheep!â€\\n\\nThis time, however, the villagers only shook their heads when they heard\\nhis cries.\\n\\nâ€œThat boy is making a fool of us again,â€ said one man. â€œLet him deal\\nwith his own mischief,â€ replied another.\\n\\nNot a single villager climbed the hill.\\n\\nThe boy shouted until his throat was sore. He waved his arms and begged\\nfor help. But no one came. The wolf chased the sheep, caught several of\\nthem, and dragged them into the forest. The boy watched helplessly,\\ntears streaming down his face.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Lesson Learned\\n\\nWhen evening came, the boy returned to the village with only a handful\\nof sheep left. His head hung low, and he could not meet the eyes of the\\nvillagers.\\n\\nâ€œI am so sorry,â€ he sobbed. â€œThere really was a wolf this time. But\\nbecause I lied before, none of you believed me.â€\\n\\nThe old man who had warned him earlier said gently, â€œYes, boy. That is\\nthe way of lies. When a liar speaks the truth, no one believes him.â€\\n\\nFrom that day forward, the boy never lied again. He had learned, through\\nbitter experience, that trust once broken is hard to win back.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Moral\\n\\nâ€œLiars are not believed, even when they tell the truth.â€\\n\\nTrust is a precious gift. Once it is lost through lies or deceit, it is\\ndifficult to regain.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nExtended Reflection\\n\\nThe story of The Boy Who Cried Wolf has been told for centuries, not\\njust to entertain, but to teach a timeless lesson.

      "The Boy Who Cried Wolf\n",
      "Long ago, in a quiet little village at the edge of a forest, there lived a young shepherd boy. His daily duty\n",
      "was simple yet important: he had to take the flock of sheep to graze on the hillside and watch over them\n",
      "so that no harm came to them.\n",
      "The villagers depended on these sheep for wool, milk, and sometimes meat. Protecting them from wild\n",
      "animals, especially wolves, was considered a great responsibility. Though the boy was trusted with this\n",
      "important task, he often found the work boring. The sheep quietly grazed on the grass, the birds\n",
      "chirped softly, and the warm sun passed slowly across the sky.\n",
      "At first, the boy tried to entertain himself by humming songs, throwing pebbles into the stream, or\n",
      "counting the sheep. But day after day, the same routine wore him out. He longed for excitement,\n",
      "something to break the silence of the long afternoons.\n",
      "---\n",
      "The First Trick\n",
      "One afternoon, as the boy sat watching the flock, a mischievous idea struck him. He thought, “If only\n",
      "something exciting would happen. What if I pretend that a wolf has come? The villagers would rush up\n",
      "the hill, and it would be funny to see their faces when they realize there’s no wolf at all!”\n",
      "So, standing up, he cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted loudly:\n",
      "“Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing my sheep!”\n",
      "The villagers, hearing his cries of alarm, dropped their tools and rushed up the hill. Some carried sticks,\n",
      "others picked up stones, all ready to protect the flock. But when they arrived, panting and sweating,\n",
      "they saw no wolf at all. The sheep grazed peacefully, and the boy sat laughing uncontrollably.\n",
      "“Ha ha ha! I fooled you all!” he chuckled.\n",
      "The villagers frowned. An old man said sternly, “Do not cry wolf when there is no wolf, boy. It is not a\n",
      "game. We came here to help you.”\n",
      "But the boy only laughed harder. When the villagers went back down the hill, he felt proud of his\n",
      "cleverness.\n",
      "---\n",
      "The Second Trick\n",
      "The very next day, the boy grew bored again. Remembering the fun he had yesterday, he decided to\n",
      "play the same trick once more.\n",
      "He stood up, jumped about, and cried even louder:\n",
      "“Wolf! Wolf! Please come quickly! A wolf is attacking the sheep!”\n",
      "The villagers looked at each other. “Could it be true this time?” they wondered. Despite their doubts,\n",
      "they rushed up the hill once again.\n",
      "\n",
      "--------Page 2------------\n",
      "But once more, they found no wolf. The boy was rolling on the ground with laughter.\n",
      "“You should have seen how fast you all ran!” he giggled.\n",
      "This time, the villagers were truly angry. One woman shook her finger at him and said, “Boy, this is no\n",
      "laughing matter. You wasted our time and made fools of us. If you cry wolf again, we may not believe\n",
      "you!”\n",
      "The boy shrugged, unconcerned. In his mind, it was only harmless fun.\n",
      "---\n",
      "The Real Wolf\n",
      "A few days later, while the sheep grazed peacefully, the boy suddenly heard a rustling sound from the\n",
      "nearby bushes. He turned his head and his heart skipped a beat. Out of the forest emerged a large,\n",
      "gray wolf with gleaming eyes and sharp teeth.\n",
      "The wolf crept closer, snarling and baring its fangs. The sheep bleated in fear, scattering in all\n",
      "directions. The boy’s face turned pale. He leaped to his feet and screamed with all his might:\n",
      "“Wolf! Wolf! Please help me! A real wolf is here! It’s attacking the sheep!”\n",
      "This time, however, the villagers only shook their heads when they heard his cries.\n",
      "“That boy is making a fool of us again,” said one man. “Let him deal with his own mischief,” replied\n",
      "another.\n",
      "Not a single villager climbed the hill.\n",
      "The boy shouted until his throat was sore. He waved his arms and begged for help. But no one came.\n",
      "The wolf chased the sheep, caught several of them, and dragged them into the forest. The boy watched\n",
      "helplessly, tears streaming down his face.\n",
      "---\n",
      "The Lesson Learned\n",
      "When evening came, the boy returned to the village with only a handful of sheep left. His head hung\n",
      "low, and he could not meet the eyes of the villagers.\n",
      "“I am so sorry,” he sobbed. “There really was a wolf this time. But because I lied before, none of you\n",
      "believed me.”\n",
      "The old man who had warned him earlier said gently, “Yes, boy. That is the way of lies. When a liar\n",
      "speaks the truth, no one believes him.”\n",
      "From that day forward, the boy never lied again. He had learned, through bitter experience, that trust\n",
      "once broken is hard to win back.\n",
      "---\n",
      "The Moral\n",
      "\n",
      "--------Page 3------------\n",
      "“Liars are not believed, even when they tell the truth.”\n",
      "Trust is a precious gift. Once it is lost through lies or deceit, it is difficult to regain.\n",
      "---\n",
      "Extended Reflection\n",
      "The story of The Boy Who Cried Wolf has been told for centuries, not just to entertain, but to teach a\n",
      "timeless lesson. Parents share it with their children to emphasize the importance of honesty. Teachers\n",
      "use it to remind students that lying may bring short-term amusement but can cause long-term harm.\n",
      "In life, people who lie may gain attention for a while, but when they truly need help, others hesitate to\n",
      "trust them. In families, friendships, workplaces, and societies, trust is the foundation of every\n",
      "relationship. Without it, cooperation and safety break down.\n",
      "The boy in the story did not just lose his sheep—he lost the confidence of his entire village. The\n",
      "laughter he enjoyed for a moment turned into sorrow that lasted long after the wolf disappeared into the\n",
      "forest.\n",
      "Thus, the tale continues to live on, reminding each generation: Speak the truth, and you will be trusted.\n",
      "Tell lies, and you may find yourself alone when you need others most.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS   \n",
      "Any programming language is implemented on a computer. Right form its inception, to the \n",
      "present day, all computer system (irrespective of  their shape & size) perform the following 5 \n",
      "basic operations. It converts the raw input data into information, which is useful to the users.  \n",
      "  \n",
      " Inputting : It is the process of entering data & instructions to the computer system.  \n",
      " Storing : The data & instr uctions are stored for either initial or additional processing, \n",
      "as & when required.  \n",
      " Processing : It requires performing arithmetic or logical operation on the saved data \n",
      "to convert it into useful information.  \n",
      " Outputting : It is the process of producing the  output data to the end user.  \n",
      " Controlling : The above operations have to be directed in a particular sequence to be \n",
      "completed.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Based on these 5 operations, we can sketch the block diagram of a computer.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Fig 1: Block Diagram  of a Computer  \n",
      "    \n",
      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "--------Page 6------------\n",
      " Input Unit : We need to first enter the data & instruction in the computer system, \n",
      "before any computation begins. This task is accomplished by the input devices. (Eg: \n",
      "keyboard, mouse, scanner, digital camera etc). This device is responsibl e for linking \n",
      "the system with the external environment. The data accepted is in a human readable \n",
      "form. The input device converts it into a computer readable form.  \n",
      "  \n",
      " Storage Unit : The data & instruction that are entered have to be stored in the \n",
      "computer. S imilarly, the end results & the intermediate results also have to be stored \n",
      "somewhere before being passed to the output unit. The storage unit provides solution \n",
      "to all these issues. This storage unit is designed to save the initial data, the \n",
      "intermediate r esult & the final result. This storage unit has 2 units: Primary storage \n",
      "& Secondary storage.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Primary Storage : The primary storage, also called as the main memory , holds the \n",
      "data when the computer is currently on. As soon as the system is switched off o r \n",
      "restarted, the information held in primary storage disappears (i.e. it is volatile in \n",
      "nature). Moreover, the primary storage normally has a limited storage capacity, \n",
      "because it is very expensive as it is made up of semiconductor devices.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Secondary Sto rage: The secondary storage, also called as the auxiliary storage, \n",
      "handles the storage limitation & the volatile nature of the primary memory. It can \n",
      "retain information even when the system is off. It is basically used for holding the \n",
      "program instructions & data on which the computer is not working on currently, but \n",
      "needs to process them later.  \n",
      "  \n",
      " Central Processing Unit :  Together the Control Unit & the Arithmetic Logic Unit \n",
      "are called as the Central Processing Unit (CPU). The CPU is the brain of the \n",
      "compu ter. Like in humans, the major decisions are taken by the brain itself & other \n",
      "body parts function as directed by the brain. Similarly in a computer system, all the \n",
      "major calculations & comparisons are made inside the CPU. The CPU is responsible \n",
      "for activa ting & controlling the operation of other units of the computer system.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Arithmetic Logic Unit : The actual execution of the instructions (arithmetic or logical \n",
      "operations) takes place over here. The data & instructions stored in the primary \n",
      "storage are t ransferred as & when required. No processing is done in the primary \n",
      "storage. Intermediate results that are generated in ALU are temporarily transferred \n",
      "back to the primary storage, until needed later. Hence, data may move from the \n",
      "primary storage to ALU & back again to storage, many times, before the processing \n",
      "is done.  \n",
      "Control Unit : This unit controls the operations of all parts of the computer but does \n",
      "not carry out any actual data processing.It is responsible for the transfer of data and \n",
      "instructions am ong other units of the computer.It manages and coordinates all the \n",
      "units of the system.It also communicates with Input/Output devices for transfer of \n",
      "data or results from the storage units.  \n",
      "--------Page 7------------\n",
      " Output Unit : The job of an output unit is just the opposite of an  input unit. It accepts \n",
      "the results produced by the computer in coded form. It converts these coded results \n",
      "to human readable form. Finally, it displays the converted results to the outside \n",
      "world with the help of output devices ( Eg :monitors, printers, pr ojectors etc..).   \n",
      "  \n",
      "So when we talk about a computer, we actually mean 2 things:  \n",
      "  \n",
      " Hardware - This hardware is responsible for all the physical work of the computer.  \n",
      " Software - This software commands the hardware what to do & how to do it.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Together, the  hardware & software form the computer system.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "This software is further classified as system software & application software.  \n",
      "System Software - System software are a set of programs, responsible for running the \n",
      "computer, controlling various operations o f computer systems and management of \n",
      "computer resources. They act as an interface between the hardware of the computer \n",
      "& the application software. E.g.: Operating System  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Application Software - Application software is a set of programs designed to solve a  \n",
      "particular problem for users. It allows the end user to do something besides simply \n",
      "running the hardware. E.g.: Web Browser, Gaming Software, etc.  \n",
      " \n",
      "--------Page 8------------\n",
      "LECTURE NOTE -2 \n",
      "INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING  \n",
      "A language that is acceptable to a computer system is called a  computer language  or \n",
      "programming language and the process of creating a sequence of instructions in such a language \n",
      "is called programming or coding . A program is a set of instructions, written to perform a specific \n",
      "task by the computer. A set of large pro gram is called software . To develop software, one must \n",
      "have knowledge of a programming language.  \n",
      "Before moving on to any programming language, it is important to know about the various types \n",
      "of languages used by the computer. Let us first know what the ba sic requirements of the \n",
      "programmers were & what difficulties they faced while programming in that language.   \n",
      "COMPUTER LANGUAGES  \n",
      "Languages are a means of communication. Normally people interact with each other through a \n",
      "language. On the same pattern, comm unication with computers is carried out through a language. \n",
      "This language is understood both by the user and the machine. Just as every language like \n",
      "English, Hindi has its own grammatical rules; every computer language is also bounded by rules \n",
      "known as syntax of that language. The user is bound by that syntax while communicating with the \n",
      "computer system.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Computer languages are broadly classified as:  \n",
      "  \n",
      " Low Level Language : The term low level highlights the fact that it is closer to a language \n",
      "which the m achine understands.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "The low level languages are classified as:  \n",
      "  \n",
      "o Machine Language : This is the language (in the form of 0’s and 1’s, called binary \n",
      "numbers) understood directly by the computer. It is machine dependent. It is \n",
      "difficult to learn and even more difficult to write programs.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "o Assembly Language : This is the language where the machine codes comprising of \n",
      "0’sand 1’s are substituted by symbolic codes (called mnemonics) to improve their \n",
      "understanding. It is the first step to improve programming s tructure. Assembly \n",
      "language programming is simpler and less time consuming than machine level \n",
      "programming, it is easier to locate and correct errors in assembly language than in \n",
      "machine language programs. It is also machine dependent. Programmers must \n",
      "have  knowledge of the machine on which the program will run.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "--------Page 9------------\n",
      " High Level Language:  Low level language requires extensive knowledge of the hardware \n",
      "since it is machine dependent. To overcome this limitation, high level language has been \n",
      "evolved which uses nor mal English, which is easy to understand to solve any problem. \n",
      "High level languages are computer independent and programming becomes quite easy and \n",
      "simple. Various high level languages are given below:   \n",
      "  \n",
      "o BASIC (Beginners All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code):  It is widely used, \n",

      "--------Page 15------------\n",
      "Stepwise explanation:   \n",
      "#include  \n",
      " The part of the compiler which actually gets your program from the source fil e is called \n",
      "the preprocessor.  \n",
      " #include <stdio.h>  \n",
      " #include is a pre -processor directive. It is not really part of our program, but instead it is \n",
      "an instruction to the compiler to make it do something. It tells the C compiler to include \n",
      "the contents of a file (in this case the system file called stdio.h).   \n",
      " The compiler knows it is a system file, and therefore must be looked for in a special place, \n",
      "by the fact that the filename is enclosed in <> characters  \n",
      "<stdio.h>  \n",
      " stdio.h  is the name of the standard library definition file for all STanDard Input and \n",
      "Output functions.   \n",
      " Your program will almost certainly want to send information to the screen and read things \n",
      "from the keyboard, and stdio.h is the name of the file in which the functions that we want \n",
      "to use are defined.  \n",
      " The function we  want to use is called printf. The actual code of printf will be tied in later \n",
      "by the linker.   \n",
      " The \".h\" portion of the filename is the language extension, which denotes an include file.  \n",
      "void  \n",
      " This literally means that this means nothing. In this case, it is referring to the function \n",
      "whose name follows.   \n",
      " Void tells to C compiler that a given entity has no meaning, and produces no error.  \n",
      "main  \n",
      " In this particular example, the only function in the program is called main .   \n",
      " A C program is typically made up of  large number of functions. Each of these is given a \n",
      "name by the programmer and they refer to each other as the program runs.   \n",
      " C regards the name main as a special case and will run this function first i.e. the program \n",
      "execution starts from main .  \n",
      "(void)  \n",
      " This is a pair of brackets enclosing the keyword void.   \n",
      " It tells the compiler that the function main has no parameters.  \n",
      " A parameter to a function gives the function something to work on.   \n",
      "--------Page 16------------\n",
      "{ (Brace)  \n",
      " This is a brace (or curly bracket). As the name impli es, braces come in packs of two - for \n",
      "every open brace there must be a matching close one.   \n",
      " Braces allow us to group pieces of program together, often called a block.   \n",
      " A block can contain the declaration of variable used within it, followed by a sequence  of \n",
      "program statements.  \n",
      " In this case the braces enclose the working parts of the function main.  \n",
      "; (semicolon)  \n",
      " The semicolon marks the end of the list of variable names, and also the end of that \n",
      "declaration statement.   \n",
      " All statements in C programs are s eparated by \";\" (semicolon) characters.   \n",
      " The \";\" character is actually very important. It tells the compiler where a given statement \n",
      "ends.  \n",
      " If the compiler does not find one of these characters where it expects to see one, then it \n",
      "will produce an error.  \n",
      "scanf  \n",
      " In other programming languages, the printing and reading functions are a part of the \n",
      "language.  \n",
      " In C this is not the case; instead they are defined as standard functions which are part of \n",
      "the language specification, but are not a part of the languag e itself.   \n",
      " The standard input/output library contains a number of functions for formatted data \n",
      "transfer; the two we are going to use are scanf (scan formatted) and printf (print \n",
      "formatted).  \n",
      "printf  \n",
      " The printf function is the opposite of scanf.  \n",
      " It takes text and values from within the program and sends it out onto the screen.   \n",
      " Just like scanf, it is common to all versions of C and just like scanf, it is described in the \n",
      "system file stdio.h.  \n",

      "A data structure  is the way data is stored in the machine and the functions used to access that \n",
      "data. An easy way to think of a data structure is a collection of related data items. An array  is a \n",
      "data structure that i s a collection of variables of one type that are accessed through a common \n",
      "name. Each element of an array is given a number by which we can access that element which is \n",
      "called an index. It solves the problem of storing a large number of values and manipula ting them.  \n",
      "Arrays  \n",
      " Previously we use variables to store the values. To use the variables we have to declare the \n",
      "variable and initialize the variable i.e, assign the value to the variable. Suppose there are 1000 \n",
      "variables are present, so it is a tedious p rocess to declare and initialize each and every variable \n",
      "and also to handle 1000 variables. To overcome this situation we use the concept of array .In an \n",
      "Array values of same type are stored. An array is a group of memory locations related by the fact \n",
      "that they all have the same name and same type. To refer to a particular location or element in \n",
      "the array we specify the name to the array and position number of particular element in the array.  \n",
      " One Dimensional Array   \n",
      "   Declaration:  \n",
      "Before using the array in the program it must be declared  \n",
      "Syntax:   \n",
      "data_type  array_name[size];  \n",
      " data_type represents the type of elements present in the array. \n",
      "array_name represents the name of the array.  \n",
      "Size represents the number of elements that can be stored in the array.   \n",

      "float sal[15]; \n",
      "char grade[20];  \n",
      "--------Page 114------------\n",
      "Here age is an integer type array, which can store 100 elements of integer type. The array sal is \n",
      "floating type array of size 15, can hold float values.  Grade is a character type array which holds \n",
      "20 characters.  \n",
      "Initialization:  \n",
      "We can explicitly initialize arrays at the time of declaration.  \n",
      "Syntax:   \n",
      "data_type array_name[size]={value1, value2,……..valueN};  \n",
      "Value1, value2, valueN are the constant values known as initializers, which are assigned to  the \n",

      "marks[0]=10, marks[1]=2, marks[2]=0, marks[3]=23, marks[4]=4  \n",
      "NOTE:   \n",
      "1. In 1-D arrays it is optional to specify t he size of the array. If size is omitted during \n",
      "initialization then the compiler assumes the size of array equal to the number of \n",

      "int marks[]={10,2,0,23,4};  \n",

      " Since insertion a nd deletion is done at one end, we don’t need to traverse the entire list for \n",

      "Application of Stack  \n",
      " A stack is useful for converting an arithmetic expression into Polish and reverse -Polish \n",
      "notation.  \n",
      " In any programming language, each arithmetic operator has a priority. An exp ression can \n",
      "be evaluated based on that priority. But still, it is difficult to evaluate an expression in a \n",
      "computer.  \n",
      " Polish mathematician Jan Lukasiewicz gave two methods of representing an arithmetic \n",
      "expression called pre -fix notation (aka Polish notation ) and post -fix notation (aka reverse -\n",
      "Polish notation). The general arithmetic expression are said to be in in -fix form.  \n",
      " In pre -fix and post -fix notations, the expressions are represented in such a way that the \n",
      "operator appears before or after the operands . As a result, no parenthesis are required to \n",
      "find which part is to be evaluated first.  \n",
      " Consider the expression  \n",
      " a+b*c  \n",
      "This is to be evaluated as  \n",
      " (a+(b*c))  \n",
      "The pre -fix notation of it is  \n",
      "    +a*bc  \n",
      "And post -fix notation is  \n",
      "abc*+   \n",
      " Now, the expressions can b e evaluated using a stack.  \n",
      " For evaluation of pre -fix operation, we scan the expression and push it in a stack one \n",
      "element at a time. Whenever we encounter two operands, we pop the two operands and \n",
      "the operator just beneath it and evaluate that part with t he operator. The result is then \n",
      "pushed to the stack. The process continues till stack is not empty.  \n",
      " Similarly for post -fix operation, we scan the expression and push it in a stack one element \n",
      "at a time. Whenever we encounter an operator, we pop the operato r and the two operands \n",
      "just beneath it and evaluate that part with the operator. The result is then pushed to the \n",
      "stack. The process continues till stack is not empty.  \n",
      " For +a*bc, + is pushed followed by a and then * and then b and then c. When c is pushed,  \n",
      "we have two operands b and c together. It is evaluated with operator *. Let the result be D. \n",
      "When D is pushed, the structure of the stack is +aD. Now a and D are two operands \n",
      "together and are evaluated with +. When plus is popped, the process stops as sta ck is now \n",

      "QUEUE  \n",
      " A queue is also a linear data structure like stack. But unlike stack, here insertion is done at \n",

      " Because of this property, it is also called First -In-First-Out (FIFO) list.  \n",
      " The insertion process is called ENQUEUE and deletion process is called DEQUEUE.  \n",
      " The end where element is inserted is called the TAIL of the queue, whereas the other end \n",
      "is called H EAD. So initially head=tail.  \n",
      " \n",
      " Queue can also be represented using an array or a linked list.  \n",
      " If we DEQUEUE an empty queue, it is called queue underflow. Similarly queue overflow \n",
      "is when we ENQUEUE a full queue.  \n",
      " In array representation, when head=tail+1, then queue is full.  \n",
      "Circular queue  \n",
      " A circular queue is one in which after reaching the last position, next element is added in \n",

      " In general queue, on reaching the end of the queue, no more elements can be added even  \n",
      "though elements in the beginning are empty (as a result of many dequeue process). \n",
