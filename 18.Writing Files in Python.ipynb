      "Write line 1:  Ingredients for biryani are extensive and vary according to the region and the type of meat and vegetables used. Meat (chicken, goat, beef, lamb,[27] prawn or fish) is the prime ingredient with rice. As is common in dishes of South Asia, vegetables are sometimes also used when preparing biryani. Corn may be used, depending on the season and availability. Navratan biryani tends to use sweeter, richer ingredients such as cashews, sultanas (kishmish), and fruits such as apples and pineapples.[23]  The spices and condiments used in biryani may include fennel seeds, ghee (clarified butter), nutmeg, mace,[28] pepper, cloves,[28] cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, coriander, mint, ginger, onions, tomatoes, green chilies,[27] star anise, and garlic. The premium varieties include saffron.[28] Some commercial recipes for biryani also include aromatic essences such as Mitha attar, kewra and rose water. Dried sour prunes (Plum is called alu bukhara) may also be added to the biryani. In nasi briyani and other variants made in Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, typical Southeast Asian spices and aromatics such as pandan leaf may be used alongside typical South Asian spices.[29]  The main ingredient that usually accompanies the spices is chicken, lamb or goat meat; special varieties might use beef or seafood instead. The dish may be served with raita, dahi chutney, or other accompaniments to soothe the biryani and lower the heat from the spices in the biryani. Other sides include seekh kebab, Qorma, curry, a sour dish of aubergine (brinjal), boiled eggs, and salad.  Preparation styles Biryani can be cooked using one of two styles/techniques, pakki (\"cooked\") and kacchi (\"raw\").[30]  In a pakki biryani, the rice, marinated meat, and any vegetables are partially (\"three-quarters\") cooked separately, before being combined into layers in a cooking vessel. Different layers of rice may be treated with different spices (e.g., with dissolved saffron or turmeric to give the rice different colours and flavours). The contents are then baked to complete the cooking and allow the flavours to combine. Alternatively, the components may be fully cooked, and then simply combined by layering before serving. In a kacchi biryani, layers of raw marinated meat are alternated in layers with wet, pre-soaked, raw rice (which may be treated with different spices as above), and cooked together by baking, or medium-to-low direct heat (typically, for at least an hour). Cooking occurs by a process of steaming from the ingredients' own moisture: the cooking vessel's lid is sealed (traditionally, with a strip of wheat dough) so that steam cannot escape (proper dum pukht). A yoghurt-based marinade at the bottom of the cooking pot provides additional flavour and moisture. Potatoes often comprise the bottom layer (a technique also used in Iranian cuisine), because, with their natural moisture content, they brown well with less risk of getting burned accidentally. The lid is not opened until the dish is ready to serve. Kacchi biryani is technically much more demanding and time-consuming than pakki biryani, for the following reasons: The different ingredients—meat, rice, vegetables—have different cooking times: tender cuts of meat/chicken can be fully cooked well before the rice is done. To prevent this, many kacchi recipes use parboiled (semi-cooked) rice rather than raw rice. If direct heat is used, there is a risk that the food layer in contact with the vessel bottom may get burned while the interior's contents are still raw. This risk is minimized by sustained baking with moderate heat or very slow cooking on low direct heat. This approach, however, increases cooking time considerably. One method is cooking the dish \"blind\", with the cooking vessel sealed, so one cannot monitor the cooking progress—it takes expertise and understanding of the raw foods used, the heat required to cook those raw foods, and how the climate can affect the cooking process. Hence making kacchi biryani requires a seasoned hand. Varieties On the Indian subcontinent  Hyderabadi egg biryani served with mirchi ka salan, raita and salad  A Hyderabadi vegetable biryani served in Tampa, U.S.  Biryani of Lahore There are many types of biryani, whose names are often based on their region of origin. For example, Sindhi biryani developed in the Sindh region of what is now Pakistan, and Hyderabadi biryani developed in the city of Hyderabad in South India.  Some have taken the name of the shop that sells it, for example: Haji Biriyani, Haji Nanna Biriyani in Old Dhaka,[31] Fakhruddin Biriyani in Dhaka,[32][33] Students biryani in Karachi, Lucky biryani in Bandra, Mumbai and Baghdadi biryani in Colaba, Mumbai.[23] Biryanis are often specific to the Muslim communities where they originate; they are usually the defining dishes of those communities.[34]  Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is a variety cooked in the neighboring towns of Ambur and Vaniyambadi in the Tirupattur district of the northeastern part of Tamil Nadu, which houses a high Muslim population. It was introduced during the time of the Nawabs of Arcot who once ruled the area. It is typically made with jeera samba rice. Nowadays, it is popular as both Ambur or Vaniyambadi style biryani as those are two prominent towns along the popular Bangalore to Chennai highway, where travellers are known to stop for eating.[35]  The Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is often accompanied by dhalcha, a sour brinjal curry, and pachadi or raitha (sliced onions mixed with plain yogurt, tomato, chilies, and salt). It is known to have a distinctive aroma and is considered light on the stomach.[citation needed] The usage of spice is moderate, and curd is used as a gravy base. It also utilizes a higher ratio of meat to rice.[16] Ambur-style biryani is popular as a street food all across South India.  Bhatkali/Navayathi biryani This is an integral part of the Navayath cuisine and a specialty of Bhatkal, a coastal town in Karnataka. Its origins are traced to the Persian traders who introduced biryani along with kababs and Indian breads. In Bhatkali biryani, the meat is cooked in an onion and green chili-based masala and layered with fragrant rice. It has a unique spicy flavour, and the rice is overwhelmingly white with mild streaks of orange. Its variations include beef, goat, chicken, titar (partridge), egg, fish, crab, prawn, and vegetable biryani.  Though similar to those in Thalassery, this biryani differs with lingering after-notes of mashed onions laced with garlic[citation needed]. A few chilies and spices littered with curry leaves lends a unique flavour to Bhatkali biryani. No oil is used.[36]  Another variety common among the Navayath mainly involves rice vermicelli being used as a substitute for rice, therefore lending this biryani the name shayya or shayyo as a result of its use. Like many other recipes, the meat, typically chicken, is first cooked with spices and yoghurt, with the vermicelli and fried onions being added later.[37]  Bohri biryani This biryani, traditionally made by the Bohri community, is one with a rich history. The Bohris, originally from Yemen, migrated mainly to Gujarat and other parts of India between the 11th and 13th centuries. As a result, the dish incorporates both Yemeni and Gujarati influences. The recipe is typically standard and can vary, although its signature ingredients include crispy potatoes along with even more tomatoes and onions. It is seemingly also a dish in Pakistan.[38]\n"
